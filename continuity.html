        <h2>Continuity</h2>
        <h3>By definition Continuity in Calculus means that there is no break in the functions graph. If a function is not continuous then it can fit into one of two categories of discontinuity, which are: Removable and Nonremovable. </h3>
        <h3>A Removable discontinuity means that... </h3>
        <p>---The limit x->c f(x) does exist</p>
        <p>--- Doesnt matter if f(c) is defined</p>
        <h3>A Removable discontinuity graph looks like this...</h3>

        <h4>Notice that the graph doesnt break, but it has a hole discontinuity</h4>
        <h3>A Nonremovable discontinuity has 2 subcategories, Which are...</h3>
        <h4>Jump discontinuity</h4>
        <p>---The lim x->c f(x) does not exist</p>
        <p>---Has a "jump" in the graph, seen in piecewise functions</p>
        <h3>A jump discontinuity graph looks like this...</h3>

        <h4>Noitce the gap, or "jump" in the graph</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>Infinite discontinuity</h4>
        <p>--- The lim x->c doesnt exist</p>
        <p>---Verticle asymptote at x=c</p>
        <h3>An infinite discontinuity graph looks like this...</h3>

        <h4>Notice how the graph will never touch 'a'</h4>
