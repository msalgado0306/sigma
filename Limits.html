        <h2>Limits</h2>
        <p>A limit is defined as "the value that the function approaches as it goes to an x value." From this point I'll be refrencing the variable C. C represents any posible x value.</p>
        <p>There are many methods to find the "Limit" of a function. The following are:</p>
        <h3><a href="limits_graph.html">Limits Graphically</a></h3>
        <h3><a href="limits_algebra.html">Limits Algebraically</a></h3>
        <h3><a href="limits_properties.html">Limits Properties</a></h3>
        <h3>Calculator</h3>

        <p> 1. Type the given equation into your Calculator</p>

        <p> 2. Use the table feature 2nd + graph note** Make sure that your table is set up to recieve input.</p>

        <p>2. Make sure Indpnt is set to "Ask" </p>

        <p> -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <br>
        <p> 3. Find the number you are finding the limit of which is indicated by the arrrow lim x-> # </p>

        <p>4. In your table youll input values depending on the lim of the number we're looking for. With that number add and subtract .001, .01, .1 and input those numbers into your table ** also include the original number</p>
        <img src="unit 1 pics/limits/calc method/table_pic.png" alt="" width="550" height="350">
        <h4> Important things to know:</h4> <p> If you get an error when inputting the original value then try to get as close to it as possible for example if you're looking for the limit as f(x) ->3 then input 3.00001 or 2.99999. Additionally if you get a y value that has an e its just your Calculator being stubborn it just means its 0 </p>
        <h4>example</h5>

        <p> -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <br>

        <p>5. Notice a trend in the numbers, as the x value is getting closer to the limit num: What happens to the value of f(x) as x aproaches the number from the left and the right? **Left means from the side you subtracted and Right means from the side you added.</p>

        <p> 6. Determine if the limit exists. If the values are aproaching the f(x) value of the original number then the limit exists, If the valures aren't aproaching the f(x) value then the limit does not exist "DNE"</p>
        <p>in this case both numbers seem to be going towards one number, which is 5 so the limit as x aproaches -2 is 5! done ^_^</p>
