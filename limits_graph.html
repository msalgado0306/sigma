    <h2>Finding Limits Graphically</h2>
    <p>Notice when x aproaches c from both sides. Left and Right if they are at the same point or "touch" then they limit exists at that y value. If they do not meet then the lim does not exist DNE.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For this example well be looking for the limit as x aproaches 0</p>

    <p>As x aproaches 0 from the left it meets at 2, as x aproaches 0 from the right it meets at 2. Thus the limit exists and its 2</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Limits to infinity</h3>
    <p>You can tell a limit is going towards infinity (positive or negative) when it seems like it doesnâ€™t meet the c value. In this example its at x = 5</p>
    <br>
    <h3>So, When do limits not exist?</h3>
    <p>Limits dont exist when theyre going towards infinity, when it makes a radical equal a negative value, or when there is an absolute value within a function.</p>

    <h3>One sided limits</h3>
    <p>One sided limits are like the name suggests, limits from a certain side either left or right. This is indicated by whether there is a "+" or "-" as an exponent on the C value. The plus indicates that they want you to solve from the right side and the minus indicated that they want you to solce from the left side. Completely disregard the other side and look at what y value is hit as x approaches c.</p>

    <p>Looking at the picture on the left, as x aproaches 2 the limit DNE, as x aproaches 2 from the left side, the limit is negative infinity. As x aproaches 2 from the left side the limit is positive infinity</p>
    <p>Looking at the image on the right, as x aproaches 2 from the left, its limit is 1, but as x aproaches 2 from the right the limit is 2 ***additionally when asked to find f(x) of a value in a piecewise function, the filled in circle is the one you should use not the open one. So f(2) is 2 </p>
